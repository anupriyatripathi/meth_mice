# meth_mice
The specific aim of this study is to investigate the epigenetic mechanisms of methamphetamine use on the microbiome of mice and offspring. To address this hypothesis, pregnant mothers were injected with methamphetamine during pregnancy and continued until weaning of the offspring. Fecal samples were collected during this period every two days for mothers. Additionally, samples were collected every two days for three weeks post-treatment to determine if potential effects would be reversed. Fecal samples from pups born to mothers treated with methamphetamine or control mother treated with saline, were collected starting at an age of 21 days and continuing up until 41 days. Tissue samples from both mothers and offspring were collected at the end of the experiment which provides us the ability to correlate microbiome changes to neurological or immunological differences. After the microbiome data analysis, important phenotypes will be mapped with epigenetic changes in mothers and offsprings.
